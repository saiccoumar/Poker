# Introduction
Welcome to my python client/server implementation of Poker for use with Artificial Intelligence algorithms! This implementation is designed from scratch with Object-Oriented Programming principles for easy modularity in creating AI Agents and abstracted for interpretability. This repository also contains some code I wrote for statistical analysis as well as data I collected from simulations. I'll be covering the usage, features, and technical aspects from the development of this project here, and be doing a more in-depth write up about the AI algorithms I'll be implementing in the future over on my medium page. Stay tuned!
